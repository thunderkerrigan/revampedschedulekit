/** SCKView is an abstract NSView subclass which implements common functionality for any
  * subclasses that display a collection of @c SCKEventView subviews provided by the
  * delegate of an associated @c SCKEventManager object. This base class provides:
  * - Basic date scope management via @c startDate, @c endDate and @c absoluteTimeInterval.
  * - Functional conversion between @c NSDate and @c SCKRelativeTimeLocation values, and
  *   also the @c relativeTimeLocationForPoint: which subclasses should override.
  * - Ability to get/set the coloring policy used to draw subviews' background.
  * - Basic event selection and deselection handling.
  * - Handling of double click on an empty space.
  * - Drag and drop feedback methods for SCKEventView class.
  * - Common event view (un)locking and relayout workflow.

#pragma mark - Event view layout

/**
 *  This methods performs a series of operations in order to relayout an array of
 *  SCKEventView objects according to their date, duration and other events in conflict.
 *  The full process implies locking all subviews' event holder (as to prevent changes
 *  on their properties while conflict calculations take place), calling
 *  @c relayoutEventView:animated: for each SCKEventView in @c eventViews and finally
 *  unlocking the previously locked event holders.
 *
 *  @discussion When an event view is being dragged, its event holder does not get locked 
 *  or unlocked.
 *  @discussion Don't override this method. See @c beginRelayout and @c endRelayout instead.
 *
 *  @param eventViews The array of SCKEventView objects to be redrawn.
 *  @param animation  Pass YES if you want relayout to have animation. Pass no instead.
